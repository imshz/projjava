# ProjJava is a port Java of Proj.NET
This project is a direct port of Proj.NET. The original project is located here: http://projnet.codeplex.com/

# ProjJava - Spatial Reference and Projection Engine
ProjJava performs point-to-point coordinate conversions between geodetic coordinate systems for use in for example Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or GPS applications. The spatial reference model used adheres to the [Simple Features specification](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfo).

# Supports
* Datum transformations
* Geographic, Geocentric, and Projected coordinate systems
* Compatible with Java and the Android plattform
* Converts coordinate systems to/from Well-Known Text (WKT) and to XML

# Projection types currently supported
* Mercator
* Transverse Mercator
* Albers
* Lambert Conformal
* Krovak
